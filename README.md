# HashiCorp React Components

This project is a [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) monorepo containing a library of react components that are shared between multiple HashiCorp web properties. It also includes a component playground that uses [swingset](https://github.com/hashicorp/swingset) to create a space where component authors and contributors can experiment with and quickly iterate on component design and functionality.

## Usage

- **Getting Started:** Run `npm i` to install base-level dependencies, then follow with `npm run bootstrap` to install dependencies for each component in the `packages` directory.
- **Running the Playground:** Run `npm start` - it will start a dev server which can be viewed at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Running Tests:**: Run `npm t` to execute the tests. To run watch mode on tests, `npm run test:watch` - this is helpful during development.

The `packages` directory contains all the individual components. Let's talk about some of the most important files:

- `index.jsx`: primary export of the component itself
- `index.test.js`: tests for the component, run using [jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- `docs.mdx`: documentation for the component, see [swingset docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/swingset#usage) for more details on the format
- `props.js`: information about the component's props, see [swingset docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/swingset#props) for more details on the format

## Environment Variables

A few of the elements in our playground rely on environment variables in order to function correctly. We have a `react-components .env.local` stored in 1Password if you'd like to quickly get started. Details on each environment variable:

- `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`
  - Used in `UsageDetails` to fetch `package.json`s from each of our projects
- `SOURCEGRAPH_URL`
  - Used in `UsageDetails` to build links out to our SourceGraph instance

## Publishing Packages

We manage and distribute packages to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). Each component is independently published and versioned.

### Prerequisites

In order to publish packages, you must:

1. Be added to the HashiCorp organization on `npm`
2. [Enable 2-factor authentication](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your npm account
3. Log into to `npm` in your CLI with [`npm login`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser)

If you have not done any of these steps, the publish script will fail.

### Publishing `--canary` releases

Canary releases allow us to publish and test in-progress changes to components.

```
npm run release:canary
```

You can consume pre-releases with something like `npm install @hashicorp/react-package-name@next`. Canary releases should only be used in staging contexts, not production.

By default, `npm run release:canary` will publish a pre-patch canary release. If you're working on feature changes or breaking changes, you'll likely want to run the appropriate versioning command within the package folder before running `npm run release:canary`. This also helps signal the versioning intent to reviewers.

**Further details**: `npm run release:canary` will publish any changed packages and their dependencies. It tags the release with the `@next` dist-tag. It also uses [Lerna's `--canary` option](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/publish#--canary) to avoid version collisions across branches.

### Publishing Production Releases

Production releases should only be published off of `master`.

```sh
npm run release
```

Any production releases should be **immediately followed up by bumping the updated package** in any consuming projects.

For most web-components packages, this means checking the `hashicorp-www-next` repo for Dependabot PRs to bump the package in question. You can view open Dependabot PRs on `hashicorp-www-next` using [the PR view with the `author:app/dependabot-preview` filter applied](https://github.com/hashicorp/hashicorp-www-next/pulls/app%2Fdependabot-preview).

### Oh no! I got a 401 and now my packages are like half-published

The current workaround is not ideal, but should completely fix the issue. Definitely reach out if you need assistance, as almost everyone on the team has run into this:

1. **Remove the "Publish" commit**. The "Publish" commit will most likely be your most recent commit, in which case the command below can be used. **These commands rewrite git history, so use caution!**

   ```sh
   git reset --hard HEAD^ # reset the previous commit
   git push origin master --force-with-lease # push new history
   ```

1. **Delete the tags** that point to the deleted publish commit

   ```sh
   git tag --delete {tagname} # delete the local tag
   git push --delete origin {tagname} # delete the remote tag
   ```

   For example:

   ```sh
   git tag --delete @hashicorp/react-secondary-nav@2.1.0
   git push --delete origin @hashicorp/react-secondary-nav@2.1.0
   ```

   If multiple packages were published, you'll need to delete tags for each individual package.

Now everything should be reset to its state prior to the publish failure.
