Changes alignment of CodeTabs tab elements from right-aligned to left-aligned. Note that if the heading prop is used, then tab elements remained right-aligned, matching previous behaviour. This release also fixes a bug in CodeTabs, where valid CodeBlock children would sometimes be incorrectly flagged as invalid.
