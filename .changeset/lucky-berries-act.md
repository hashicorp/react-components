- ðŸ’¥âœ¨ BREAKING CHANGE: Converts to CSS modules.
  - Consumers will need to remove any `@hashicorp/react-product-features-list/style.css` imports.
  - To support overrides in projects, consumers can use the `className` prop.
    - For example, consumers can pass `className="g-product-features-list` to retain existing overrides.
