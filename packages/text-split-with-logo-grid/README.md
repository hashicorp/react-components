# Text Split With Logo Grid

Display a logo grid alongside a title, description, and links.

## Note on Props

- `logoSlugs` are mapped to SVG images through the [`mktg-assets`](https://github.com/hashicorp/mktg-assets) package. These are then passed as an array of `images` to `@hashicorp/react-text-split-with-image-grid`.
- `textSplit` props are passed directly through to `@hashicorp/react-text-split-with-image-grid`.
