# Pricing Features

The `<PricingFeatures />` component is used to display an array of feature section including a heading, optional footnote, and content. Content can either be feature tabs with the table data as its content or table data. On mobile, a block is displayed that contains a pdf download button. Each component is exported and available for use on their own:

- `Table`
- `Tabs`
- `DownloadBlock`

This package also contains a helper function used to format incoming data from DatoCMS `normalizeTableData`.
