componentName: NavPanel
---

The NavPanel package includes two variants of NavPanels, the ProductsPanel and the StandardPanel. Each panel should be used as the content for a navigation dropdown.
You can see in the examples below that each panel needs to be contained in the NavigationMenu.Content section of the overall navigation. More info on using the Navigation menu components can be found [here](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu)
