# Error View

A component used to display an error view, within layouts that use `g-grid-container`.

## `useErrorPageAnalytics`

The `useErrorPageAnalytics` hook is used within the `ErrorView` component, and is provided as a named export from `@hashicorp/react-error-view`. This hook is intended for use cases where the opinionated, `g-grid-container`-based styles of the default `ErrorView` component are not suited to a project.
