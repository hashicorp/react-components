      Certain Vault backends utilize plugins to extend their functionality
      outside of what is available in the core Vault code. Often times these
      backends will provide both builtin plugins and a mechanism for
      executing external plugins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Builtin plugins are shipped with Vault, often for commonly used
      implementations, and require no additional operator intervention to
      run. Builtin plugins are just like any other backend code inside
      Vault.

      Lists Unordered
    </h2>
    <p>
      An extremely basic example of an unordered list looks something like
      this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One list item, could be short</li>
      <li>A second list item, also not long</li>
      <li>
        Third list item, with a bit more detail that might make it wrap to
        two lines
      </li>
      <li>
        List item number four, with a considerable amount of text that
        should probably wrap to a newline, as this line is too long not to
        wrap
      </li>
      <li>A fifth list item, short again</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An more complex example of an unordered list looks something like
      this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Multi-paragraph list item. Certain Vault backends utilize plugins
          to extend their functionality outside of what is available in the
          core Vault code. Often times these backends will provide both
          builtin plugins and a mechanism for executing external plugins.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is another paragraph of text, nested within the first list
          item. External plugins, on the other hand, are not shipped with
          the Vault binary and must be registered to Vault by a privileged
          Vault user. This section of the documentation will describe the
          architecture and security of external plugins.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A second list item, also with multiple paragraphs and nested
          content. Code blocks can be nested within list items.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>

        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Third list item, again with multiple paragraphs and nested
          content. We should probably build out detailed examples to ensure
          all content works as expected when nested within list items, even
          when nested multiple levels deep.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Here are a few sub-items.</li>
          <li>Another sub-item in a nested list</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A third nested list item it could also contain nested content,
              such as a short code snippet:

              <code>A short code snippet</code>
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A fourth nested list item</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The first item in a list nested three levels deep
                <ul>
                  <li>We have a few different bullet styles</li>
                  <li>
                    These nested lists show the extent of them
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Further nesting, if you really want to use it,
                        doesn't have different bullets
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            An example bullet in an unreasonably deep level

          List item number four, with a considerable amount of text that

          List item number four, with a considerable amount of text that
          should probably wrap to a newline, as this line is too long not to

          A fifth list item, again with paragraph text. Certain Vault
          backends utilize plugins to extend their functionality outside of
          what is available in the core Vault code. Often times these
          backends will provide both builtin plugins and a mechanism for
          executing external plugins.
