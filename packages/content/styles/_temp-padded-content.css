/*
Compromise / debt:
This globally scoped className allows the deprecated
"padded" appearance of g-content to be retained.

This is intended as a temporary measure while we
refactor all uses of g-content to set spacing around
content at the project level.

Once that refactor is complete, we should
remove this class.
